            <h2>What is Oska?</h2>
            <p>
                Oska is a two-player abstract strategy board game, inspired by checkers, 
                where the objective is to move your pieces to the opposite side of the board before your opponent does.
                Players move their pieces diagonally, and can capture opponent pieces by jumping over them. 
                The unique twist is that the player who gets all their remaining (active) pieces to the opposite end of the board wins, 
                which means losing pieces can be advantageous. 
            </p>
            <h3>How to play:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can move one step diagonally forward into an empty space.</li>
                <li>
                    You can capture your opponent's piece by jumping diagonally over it.
                    Multiple jumps in a single turn are not allowed.
                </li>
                <li>The first player to move all their pieces to the opposite end of the board wins.</li>
                <li>Remember: Sometimes, losing your pieces can help you win!</li>
            </ul>
